Part 3: Understanding Data
Objective: Craft SQL queries to answer specific analytical questions. Approach: Formulated and executed various queries to explore the relationships between noise complaints, greenery, and rent in NYC. Tools Used: PostgreSQL, Python.

Part 4: Visualizing Data
Objective: Create insightful visualizations based on the analyzed data. Methodology: Developed multiple visualizations, including geospatial plots, to depict the data effectively. Tools Used: Python (Matplotlib, GeoPandas), Jupyter Notebook.

Contribution
Both group members equally contributed to the project, collaborating on data cleaning, analysis, SQL query formulation, and visualization creation.
